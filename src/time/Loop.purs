-- makeLoop will take eventually another param which is the results of traversing all the computations

-- comment from cvlad
-- Looks a lot like you're writing an interpreter, but in a quite explicit way. 
-- If you're not familiar with Free Monads, 
-- maybe it's worth watching @natefaubionâ€™s excellent presentation (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKkxmVFcd74) and playing with the idea. 
-- Perhaps even a look into `purescript-run` is worth it. (edited)
